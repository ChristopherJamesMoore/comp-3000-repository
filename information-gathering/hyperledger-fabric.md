Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source, enterprise-grade distributed ledger platform. It is a project under the Linux Foundation and is designed for developing blockchain solutions with a modular architecture.

## Key Characteristics

*   **Permissioned Network**: Operates as a permissioned blockchain, meaning all participants are known and authorized.
*   **Modular Architecture**: Allows for interchangeable components, including pluggable consensus mechanisms and membership services.
*   **Smart Contracts (Chaincode)**: Business processes are automated using smart contracts, which are called "chaincode" in Fabric. These can be written in general-purpose programming languages like Java, Go, and Node.js.
*   **Distributed Ledger**: It maintains a distributed ledger where transactions are trackable and irreversible.
*   **Confidentiality**: Supports confidentiality through its channel architecture and private data features.
