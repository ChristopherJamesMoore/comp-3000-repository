IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) storage is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network protocol for storing and sharing files. Unlike traditional centralized storage systems that rely on a single server, IPFS distributes data across a network of nodes globally.

## Key Aspects

*   **Decentralisation**: IPFS operates on a peer-to-peer network, meaning files are distributed among many computers rather than being stored on a central server.
*   **Content Addressing**: Instead of locating files by their address (like a URL), IPFS identifies files by their content. When a file is uploaded, it's broken into smaller chunks, and each chunk is cryptographically hashed to create a unique Content Identifier (CID).
*   **Resilience and Efficiency**: By storing copies of data across multiple nodes, IPFS ensures that if one node goes offline, the data can still be retrieved from another, providing continuous accessibility.
*   **Use Cases**: IPFS is used for decentralized storage, content distribution, and file sharing. It can act as a complementary file system for public blockchains and other peer-to-peer systems.
